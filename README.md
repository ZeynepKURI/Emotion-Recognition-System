Emotion Recognition System
The Emotion Recognition System is a web-based application that uses machine learning models provided by Roboflow to detect and classify human emotions in real-time. The project leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development, providing users with an interactive and visually appealing interface for detecting emotions from images or video streams.

Introduction
This project is designed to recognize emotions (such as happy, sad, angry, etc.) from real-time video or image input. It uses a pre-trained machine learning model hosted on Roboflow, integrated with frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless interaction and real-time detection.

Features
Real-time emotion detection using the webcam or uploaded images.
Display of the detected emotion on the user interface.
Supports multiple emotion categories.
Responsive design for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
Integration with Roboflow’s API for model inference.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that you have the following:

A modern web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)
A webcam (for real-time video emotion recognition)
Access to Roboflow for the pre-trained emotion recognition model.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Kodu kopyala
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/emotion-recognition-system.git
cd emotion-recognition-system
Get your Roboflow API Key:

Sign up on Roboflow and create an account.
Get the API key for your trained emotion recognition model.
Configure the JavaScript file:

Open script.js and replace the API_KEY and MODEL_URL placeholders with your actual Roboflow API key and model URL.
Example:

javascript
Kodu kopyala
const API_KEY = 'your-roboflow-api-key';
const MODEL_URL = 'https://detect.roboflow.com/your-model-url';
Usage
Start the Application:

Open index.html in a web browser. You should be able to see the UI with options to either:

Use your webcam for real-time emotion detection.
Upload an image for emotion recognition.
Using Webcam:

Click on the "Start Webcam" button, and grant the browser permission to access your webcam.
The system will start recognizing emotions in real time and display the detected emotion on the screen.
Upload an Image:

Use the "Upload Image" button to upload a photo, and the model will analyze the image to detect the emotion.
